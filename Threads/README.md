# Pointer Arithmetic with Void Pointers in C

## 📌 Overview
This program demonstrates **pointer arithmetic** in C by typecasting `void*` to `int*`.  
It alternates between incrementing and decrementing a pointer, showing how the pointer's address changes and how dereferencing at different positions affects the output.

---

## 💡 Features
- Pointer typecasting (`void*` → `int*`)
- Pointer arithmetic (`id++`, `id--`)
- Passing pointers to functions
- Observing memory behavior in C
